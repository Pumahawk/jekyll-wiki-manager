you firt documentation.

We can begin with a simple documentation.

and link it in home.

For exemple imagine that you want to create a documentation called "_How to make it_".
Create a file `/_docs/How to make it.md`. Initialize it adding this following line 
at the begin of the file.

```markdown

layout: wiki
title: How to make it

```

Now write your content in __markdown__ like this.

```markdown
