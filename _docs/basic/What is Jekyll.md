# What is Jekyll

I'm not talking about Dr. Jekyll but I'm talking about a really famous software
written in ruby to make static website. Of course this small description doeasn't
let you undertand the adnvantage to use __Jekyll__ so let me say something on this
software.

__Jekyll__ let you separate the layout of your website from your content.

So you can write your template using HTML, Sass and the template engine [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid)
to make your website beautifull and then you can write your content, like article
of blog, in markdown in a single file and put on a special folder and automatically 
__Jekyll__ generate a page for your content with your beautifull template.
