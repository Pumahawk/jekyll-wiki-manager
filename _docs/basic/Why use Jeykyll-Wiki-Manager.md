# Why use Jekyll-Wiki-Manager

If Jekyll is so beautifull why we should use Jekyll-Wiki-Manager to write documentation
and not use Jekyll directly?

Jekyll have a lot of functionality to write pages but is optimized to make blog and 
not documentation.

If you use this version of Jekyll you have a lot of functionality to write documentation.
For exemple you can make a guide divided in different articles, access to a single page
documentation generator and make different guide.

All of this functionality are really easy to use and configure.
