  <h1 id="what-is-jekyll">What is Jekyll</h1>

<p>I’m not talking about Dr. Jekyll but I’m talking about a really famous software
written in ruby to make static website. Of course this small description doeasn’t
let you undertand the adnvantage to use <strong>Jekyll</strong> so let me say something on this
software.</p>

<p><strong>Jekyll</strong> let you separate the layout of your website from your content.</p>

<p>So you can write your template using HTML, Sass and the template engine <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/liquid">Liquid</a>
to make your website beautifull and then you can write your content, like article
of blog, in markdown in a single file and put on a special folder and automatically 
<strong>Jekyll</strong> generate a page for your content with your beautifull template.</p>

  <h1 id="why-use-jekyll-wiki-manager">Why use Jekyll-Wiki-Manager</h1>

<p>If Jekyll is so beautifull why we should use Jekyll-Wiki-Manager to write documentation
and not use Jekyll directly?</p>

<p>Jekyll have a lot of functionality to write pages but is optimized to make blog and 
not documentation.</p>

<p>If you use this version of Jekyll you have a lot of functionality to write documentation.
For exemple you can make a guide divided in different articles, access to a single page
documentation generator and make different guide.</p>

<p>All of this functionality are really easy to use and configure.</p>
